## The Gist
Growing up, I was interested in psychology, medicine, Lego and music. Soon, I became more interested in what makes people tick. Then I started learning about how to push boundaries to find reasons and inner mechanisms. Eventually I began to discover the elaborate ways we can work with and amongst  ourselves to build almost anything. And then I found out about software engineering. 

While this has been going on I successfully married the most beautiful woman in the world and started an amazing family with her. We live in the NY area at the moment. 

I like to architect and research powerful, wholesome ideas. I'm motivated to find new ways for people to work better together. I like to strive for implicit excellence that is obvious and essential. Healthy accomplishment is an honorable thing to achieve!
 
##  Software Engineering
Things on my mind right now:
- **Planning** is the foundation of what needs to be done. It is worth learning how to plan in a way that supports the work efficiently. This is not one size fits all. 
- **Communicating** can be bullet points, a cookie trail, a helpful comment, a link or a diagram. It works if it helps someone else figure something out. Knowing what people *will* look for and guiding them *in advance* is where effective team work starts to materialize.
- **Ownership** doesn't have to fall on one person at a time. Effective systems encourage different people to assume ownership of different stations at different times. Criteria for ownership should be defined to the point that anyone can help be responsible for a system.
- **Tooling** can't come before a plan. Although it can help inspire a plan. Please do not confuse tools with plans. 
- **Refactoring** is top priority. There is never a 'right' time. Refactor first and ship later when possible. Because if you noticed it needs to be done, it's time.
