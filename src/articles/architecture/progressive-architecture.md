headline: A few of my thoughts on software architecture.
---

## What 
- The idea of architecture dictates that everything should be figured out initially. 
- Life dictates the opposite.
- Progressive Architecture (if someone has a better term, let's update the article) allows for extensibility of the plan.
- A litmus test for progressive architecture can be: "Does this architecture need to be flexible to be good?"
## Why
- Architecture seeks to define a representation of something before it is built.
- Software that is built should be extensible.
- Architecture that represents this software should communicate this extensibility.
