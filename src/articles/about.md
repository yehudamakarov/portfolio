## In General 

I like to architect and research powerful, wholesome ideas. I'm motivated to find new ways for people to work better together. I strive for implicit excellence that is obvious and essential. Healthy accomplishment is an honorable thing to achieve!

Things on my mind right now:
- **Planning** is the foundation of anything at hand. However this Planning happens, it should anchor the goalposts of the objective. This Planning is not one size fits all. 
- **Communicating** can be bullet points, a cookie trail, a helpful comment, a link, or a #diagram. It works if it helps someone else figure something out. Knowing what people *will* look for and guiding them *in advance* is where practical teamwork starts to materialize.
- **Ownership** doesn't have to fall on one person at a time. Effective systems encourage different people to accept Ownership of various positions at specific times. We should define criteria for Ownership to the point that anyone can help be responsible for a system. Then anyone can help out. Someone may even make themselves an expert!
- **Tooling** can't come before a plan. Although it can help inspire a plan. Please do not confuse tools with plans. 
- **Refactoring** is a top priority. There is never a 'right' time. Refactor first and ship later when possible. Because if it is in your way, it's a great time to clean it up and rethink it.
