# Progressive Architecture
## What
Imagine a building is being designed. This building will sit on a cliff face. The foundation needs to be designed with precision. Now, while the building is being developed, there is a project to install a particular lattice into the cliff face. 

As the architect, you know that designing the foundation of this building will be more successful with the lattice, but it is not done yet. If you continue with the original plan, not having benefitted from this lattice by the time the project is done will be unsettling at best. What is the best way forward?
